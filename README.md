## Task
Dataset: An augmented and edited version of the Dataset QSAR biodegradation Data Set

## Aim:
- Students should provide the best possible classification models using whatever method covered in class
- Variable to Classify is Biodegradable
- Models should examine different hyperparameters and select the best one [Remember: everything else being similar, the simplest models should be prefered]
- Students should do Simple Cross Validation (testing=25% of all data) for evaluating the models, but the same data partitions must be used for all models

## Processing notes
- Data is not normalized
- Data has categorical and continuous variables
- Data has missing values which should be handled accordingly
- Data has 41 columns, and not all are important

## Objectives
- Produce the best Classification model
- Identify the most significant features
